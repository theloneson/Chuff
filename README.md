# 🌀 Spin Quest

**Spin Quest** is an NFT minting platform with a fun twist — instead of just buying your spot, users can spin a rarity-based wheel to win a **whitelist (WL)**. A whitelist gives you access to **mint the NFT for free**, bypassing the regular $100 price.

Whether you’re early or just lucky, Spin Quest adds excitement and fairness to NFT drops.
